# Sample Android App That Uses OpenCV Without OpenCVManager

This Android Studio sample project uses OpenCV without its Java wrapper and without OpenCVManager.

You need to substitute the paths to OpenCV .so libraries and headers inside of **build.gradle** and **CMakeLists.txt** to point to the location where you store them.

I used this sample project in my blog post about building OpenCV from source and using it on Android
